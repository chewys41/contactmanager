--PROPS-- 
props are properties we can pass them into components like attributes
the way that we can access props in a functional component is a bit different froma class component
when its a class component we access props by using this.props
when its a functional we access props by props.

--default props--
    example is the header, you dont always have something to show up so you want something in by default
--Prop Types-- impt tab for importing
validate data coming in
in header we imported proptypes then made a header.proptypes at bottom

--styling and Css--
-inline styling
    - <h1 style={{ color: "red", fontSize: "50px" }}>{branding}</h1>
-variable styling
    const headingStyle = {
  color: "red",
  fontSize: "50px"
};
after declaring it you pass it in to element with style={}
-specific style sheet for each component
    you can create a file with filename.Css
    then use regular css 

    React.Fragment tags take out unnecessary elements that you dont need. we took out a <div> inside Contacts.js 
    in Contact.js where we have a div with a card  you cant use it


--STATE--
 ways to add STATE
 in a constructor which is a method that runs when the object or component is mounted

 --events--
    use the THIS keyword because its going to refer to a method in the same class
    lifecycle methods included with the component class like render,componentDidMount, and more. in these core methods we can use this without doing any extra work.
    when you use custom methods instead of lifecycle you can do a couple things 
            - bind it directly in the render where your calling it ex. onClick= {this.onShowClick.bind(this)}
            - you can put in the constructor like this.onShowClick = this.onShowClick.bind(this) -- then use this.onShowClick in the render
            - another way is to turn the onShow click into an arrow function and you dont have to bind anything.
                        example: onShowClick = () => {                      instead of onShowClick() {
                                     console.log(this.state);                   }             
                                     };

-every event can get passed in an event object     onShowClick = (e) => {
                                                    console.log(e.target);
                                                        };


how to pass in a parameter if--
    if we have an event and we want onShowClick to pass something in and usually it would be an id or something you would use .bind
        example: onClick = {this.onShowClick.bind(this, 1)}
        you would also have to go to the onShowClick function and pass in the parameter in the () after the event thats in it

--STATE--
you cant change state directly with this.state. you need this.setState

manipulating the state of a component from another component

React Router
    npm install react-router-dom
        {BrowserRouter} basically the parent component that stores all of your route components
        {Route} which holds all routes
        {Switch} allows us to have a default or not found page sort of thing

        -----lifecycle mthods----
        https://medium.com/@nancydo7/understanding-react-16-4-component-lifecycle-methods-e376710e5157

            
        lifecucle methods are only availible in class based components

        -render is a lifecycle method
        -componentDidMount fires whatever you put in that function is going to fire off after the component mounts
                -this is usually hwere you make your http calls to an API or to a back end . 
                if your fetching data from within component and puitting it into the component state or whatever 
                this is where you would cal the initial request
        -componentWillMount
                -this runs before it mounts. so componentDidMount runs first then componentWillMount
        -componentDidUpdate
                -this is only going to run when the component updates. when component updates and rerenders this will run
        -componentWillUpdate
        -componentWillRecieveProps
            -this takes in nextProps and nextState
            -when your component receives new properties then this will run.. usually used with redux
        -static getDerivedStateFromProps(nextProps, prevState) {
      
  }
