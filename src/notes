--PROPS-- 
props are properties we can pass them into components like attributes
the way that we can access props in a functional component is a bit different froma class component
when its a class component we access props by using this.props
when its a functional we access props by props.

--default props--
    example is the header, you dont always have something to show up so you want something in by default
--Prop Types-- impt tab for importing
validate data coming in
in header we imported proptypes then made a header.proptypes at bottom

--styling and Css--
-inline styling
    - <h1 style={{ color: "red", fontSize: "50px" }}>{branding}</h1>
-variable styling
    const headingStyle = {
  color: "red",
  fontSize: "50px"
};
after declaring it you pass it in to element with style={}
-specific style sheet for each component
    you can create a file with filename.Css
    then use regular css
